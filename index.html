                        An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
                        cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
                        originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
                        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North
                        America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                        cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

                        Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant
                        fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by
                        clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much
                        slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size
                        of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various
                        tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone
                        to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of
                        organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on
                        disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

                        Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly
                        half of the total.[3]

                <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
                <p>The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic root
                    *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in general. This is ultimately derived from
                    Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both
                    words[clarification needed] is uncertain.</p>
                <p>As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than
                    berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English word appel of paradis, meaning a
                    banana.[4] This use is analogous to the French language use of pomme.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and
                        up
                        to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined
                        by
                        rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored
                        simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[5]</p>
                    <p>Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on
                        spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge
                        that
                        gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The
                        central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a
                        larger fruit.[5][6]</p>
                    <p>The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of
                        sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in
                        diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger
                        apple, while apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little
                        fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted,
                        though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly
                        russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[8]
                        The
                        exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also
                        occur.[9]</p>
